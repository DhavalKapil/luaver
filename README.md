# Lua Version Manager - luavm

Command line tool to manage and switch between different versions of lua, LuaJIT and luarocks.

## Features

1. Installs/Uninstalls any version of 'lua', 'LuaJIT' or 'luarocks' with a single command.
2. Switches between different versions of 'lua', 'LuaJIT' or 'luarocks' easily and without glitches.
3. Consistency between 'lua' and 'luarocks' maintained - Rocks and configurations for different lua versions are stored differently.

## Requirements

Requires `wget`, `make`.

You may need to install some dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev 
```

Also, if you are planning to install earlier versions of Lua(which are 32 bit) on 64 bit machines, you may need to install some 32 bit libraries first: 

```sh
sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5-dev
```

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DhavalKapil/luavm/master/install.sh | . ./install.sh
```
